                <p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) is investigating a prominent realtor amid numerous complaints regarding stalled real estate projects. This inquiry raises essential questions about transparency and accountability within a sector grappling with rising interest rates and increased construction costs. As buyers express frustration over delays, the OSC’s investigation underscores the need for stricter regulations to protect consumer interests.</p>
